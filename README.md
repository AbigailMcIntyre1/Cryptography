# Cryptography
Projects from my Cryptography class.
<br><br>

<h2>Project One - Caesar Cipher</h2>
<br>Encryption: </b>
The user is prompted for a key with a value of 1-25. They are then prompted for the plaintext to be encrypted and any special characters are removed. The encrypted text is displayed uppercase in groups of 5 characters with two spaces in between. <br><br>

<b>Decryption: </b>
The user is prompted for a key with a value of 1-25. They are then prompted for the encrypted text to be decrypted. The decrypted text is displayed lowercase in groups of 5 characters with two spaces in between.

<h2>Project Two - Vigen√®re Cipher</h2>
<b>Encryption: </b>
The user is prompted for a keyword that will be used to encrypt the plaintext. The user can then enter the file name of the plaintext to be encrypted. When the encryption is complete, the user can choose to display results to a screen or write them to a file.<br><br>

<b>Decryption: </b>
The user is prompted for the file with encrypted text to be decrypted. The program then displays the frequency of each character in the whole file. Afterwards, it uses the Friedman test and index of coincedence to determine the length of the keyword. As it calculates each letter of the keyword, it displays the associated character frequencies used to calculate it. After the keyword is calculated, it is displayed along with 60 lines of decrypted text. The user can then either change the length of the keyword (which the program then recalculates the keyword based on that length), manually enter a keyword, or select that they are happy with the results. After the user is happy with their results, they can choose to display the results to the screen or write them to a file.
